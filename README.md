# TextFileArrTransformer

This repository contains the file myFile, which is located in the output folder. Here is its content:
1 2, 33 44, 51, 6,7, 8 9 5 105
1 2 3 4 9 8 7 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ,10 15 14

My program reads these lines and places the elements into arrays, which can be further transformed using functions.
